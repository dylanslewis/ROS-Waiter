<h2>
<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>This App is part of the Restaurant Ordering System, and is designed to work alongside <a href="http://dylanslewis.github.io/ROS-Manager/">Manager</a> and <a href="http://dylanslewis.github.io/ROS-Kitchen/">Kitchen</a>. </p>

<h2>
<a id="current-functionality" class="anchor" href="#current-functionality" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Current functionality</h2>

<p>Waiter currently only has core functionality and is still in development. However, the current version provides the following functionality:</p>

<h3>
<a id="login" class="anchor" href="#login" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Login</h3>

<p><img src="http://i59.tinypic.com/35875h3.png" align="center" height="445" width="250"></p>

<p>Restaurants login to the App using the credentials they used to create an account in <a href="http://dylanslewis.github.io/ROS-Manager/">Manager</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="order-management" class="anchor" href="#order-management" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Order management</h3>

<p><img src="http://i60.tinypic.com/wtddo4.png" align="center" height="445" width="250"></p>

<p>Waiters can easily see the current state of all their orders, and even how long until the next dish is ready. This unprecedented ease of managing orders will help waiters to provide a better service to their customers.</p>

<h3>
<a id="ordering-process" class="anchor" href="#ordering-process" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ordering process</h3>

<p><img src="http://i62.tinypic.com/2hgrasy.jpg" align="center" height="445" width="250"></p>

<p>Waiter covers the entire ordering process, from setting the table number to generating an emailing the bill to the customer. The Waiter is always kept up to date on the status of each ordered item, which synchronises with the <a href="http://dylanslewis.github.io/ROS-Kitchen/">Kitchen</a> App. Furthermore, the App uses colours to help communicate the most relevant order items that need the user's attention.</p>

<p><img src="http://i61.tinypic.com/i1jkna.png" align="center" height="445" width="250"></p>

<p>Navigating the menu is as easy as finding a contact on your phone. The App clearly highlights items that have already been ordered, and shows customisations that have been made to dishes.</p>

<h3>
<a id="discounts" class="anchor" href="#discounts" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Discounts</h3>

<p><img src="http://i58.tinypic.com/2qxaiyt.png" align="center" height="445" width="250"></p>

<p>Discounts can be applied to the whole bill or individual items, and can be a percentage or amount deduction. Future versions will also allow easy input of offer codes that the customer may present.</p>

<h3>
<a id="push-notifications" class="anchor" href="#push-notifications" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Push notifications</h3>

<p><img src="http://i59.tinypic.com/2wbx9i1.png" align="center" height="445" width="250"></p>

<p>There will be times when the waiter isn't looking at the app, but still wants to be alerted of anything that needs their attention. The user receives notifications of completed dishes, so that they can collect them promptly from the kitchen to provide the highest level of service to their customers.</p>

<h2>
<a id="known-issues" class="anchor" href="#known-issues" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Known issues</h2>

<ul>
