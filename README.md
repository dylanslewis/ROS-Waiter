ROS-Waiter
==========

This app is designed to work alongside Manager and Kitchen, as part of the Restaurant Ordering System app suite.

The app has limited functionality at the moment, including:
- allow a restaurant to login to the system
- allow a waiter to login to the system
- waiters can manage Orders
- waiters can add OrderItems to Orders
- waiters can view Order's OrderItems, categorised by their course
- waiters can apply Discounts to Orders and OrderItems

Eventually, this app will provide all the features needed by a Waiter in order to perform any task that they may encounter while working in a restaurant. The app currently syncs all order data with the other apps in the suite, but manipulation of this data is not always possible.
